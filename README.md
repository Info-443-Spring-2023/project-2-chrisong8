The system we're analyzing is Firebase, a backend platform created by Google. It gives developers essential real-time features such as authentication, databases and intergration for a variety of applications. Firebase also offers serverless cloud functions that allow developers to run code in response to events without worrying about the infrastructure of the code. This helps developers by simplifying app development to use ready-made and scalable backend services such that they can focus on other aspects such as UIs.
